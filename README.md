	  This server requires Express.js, the common backend javascript thingie

	  If you need to install Express.js, the following command worked for me in Bash terminal:

	  npm install express --save

	  To run this server, I start it in the terminal using NODE:
	  	node moods.js
	  And then in a browser window typing:
	  	localhost:3000 or whatever port on which the node tells me it is listening
